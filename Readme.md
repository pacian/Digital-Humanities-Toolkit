# Digital Humanities Tools

Online or downloadable tools that are free, free to students, or have generous trial periods without tight usage constraints, watermarks, or other spoilers. Bias toward tools that can be run online or installed on a personal computer without needing an institutional server. (Also see [Other Tool Lists](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools#othertoollists))

**Note about organization:** At present, these tools are organized in an improvised scheme of categories. For the most deliberate and comprehensive taxonomy of digital-humanities activities, objects, and techniques currently available, see [TaDiRAH](https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH/tree/master/reading). (See also [about TaDiRAH](https://acrl.ala.org/dh/2014/05/21/tadirah-building-capacity-integrated-access/))

- [Synonym Machine]() (set of Python scripts that download "famous works of literature and replaces specified parts of speech with random synonyms. The script is currently configured to do this with Moby Dick, in reaction to Robin Sloan's fascinating question: if you replaced every adjective with a close synonym, would it be fair to call this new text by the same title?")

# Digital Humanities Examples

(Selected projects and writings chosen to provide beginners in DH with a blend of "best" and "doable" (also: technically advanced and less-advanced) aim points for their own work. The selection is biased toward the work of individuals or small teams, though some more extensive projects are included. Note: this selection is eclectic. It is not intended to be a comprehensive or proportionally accurate sample of DH across the disciplines.

[The Networked Corpus](http://www.networkedcorpus.com/) ("provides a new way to navigate large collections of texts. Using a statistical method called topic modeling, it creates links between passages that share common vocabularies, while also showing in detail the way in which the topic modeling program has “read” the texts. We are using the Networked Corpus to analyze earlier genres and concepts of topical knowledge from the development of commonplacing, anthologizing, and indexing in the early modern period through the nineteenth century"; provides Python script for others to use)

### Christie, Alex, et al.

[Humanities on the Z-axis](http://dharchive.org/paper/DH2014/Paper-724.xml) (from abstract of paper about the project: "Through a combination of techniques in three-dimensional (3D) fabrication, geospatial mapping, speculative computing, and pattern analysis, z-axis research expresses the geospatial narratives of modernist novels by geo-referencing them and then using that geo-data to transform base layers of maps from the modernist period. The output of the research includes warped, 3D maps of cities (e.g., Paris and Dublin) central to modernist literary production. These maps can be viewed as 3D models on a screen or as physical prototypes in hand, and they are currently being transformed using geo-data drawn from novels by Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, and Jean Rhys. Ultimately, they show how modernist authors wrote the city, and findings suggest they contradict existing research in modernist studies about how, exactly, cities are expressed in modernist novels.")

["Geoparsing 19th-Century Travel Narratives"](http://www.mollydesjardin.com/projects/geoparser.html) ("This project attempts to divide text narratives by location, and to find representative or key phrases within them. The corpus consists of 19th-century British travel narratives. The methodology uses a number of heuristics, most based on syntax, to identify when the narrator has arrived or is departing a location, and to identify that location. A simple methodology uses frequent nouns and sentences which contain both a frequent noun and an adjective to choose representative phrases, here used as a kind of sentiment analysis.")

Digital traces of book culture (by which I mean user reviews, ratings and the algorithmic trails that our browsing and purchasing actions leave online) allow us to make claims about relatively large groups of readers and consumers of books, creating opportunities for the ‘distant reading’ of literary fame, but without losing the specificity of individual texts and authors.") |

## Quick Start (Common Text-Analysis Tools & Resources)

A minimal selection of common tools and resources to get instructors and students started working with text collections quickly. (These tools are suitable for use with moderate-scale collections of texts, and do not require setting up a Python, R, or other programming-language development environment, which is typical for advanced, large-scale text analysis.)

### Text-Preparation Tools

(Start here to clean, section, and wrangle texts to optimize them for text analysis)

- [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/upload) (Included in the Lexos online text-analysis workflow platform are tools for uploading, cleaning [scrubbing] texts, sectioning texts [cutting or chunking], and applying stopwords, lemmatization, and phrase consolidations)
- [See also [fuller list of Text-Preparation Tools](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools#tools-text-preparation) indexed on the tools page of DH Toychest]

### Text Analysis Tools

- [AntConc](http://www.antlab.sci.waseda.ac.jp/software.html) (Concordance program with multiple capabilities commonly used by the corpus linguistics research community; with versions for Windows, Mac & Linux; site includes video tutorials. The tool can be used to generate a word frequency list, view words in a KWIC concordance view, locate word clusters and n-grams, and compare word usage to a reference corpus such as a corpus linguistics corpus of typical language use in a nation and time period)
  - Heather Froehlich, ["Getting Started with AntConc"](http://hfroehlich.wordpress.com/workshops/getting-started-with-antconc/) (excellent tutorial for getting started)
- [Lexos](http://lexos.wheatoncollege.edu/upload) (Online integrated workflow platform for text analysis that allows users to upload texts, prepare and clean them in various ways, and then perform cluster analyses of various kinds and create visualizations from the results; can also be installed on one's own server) (Note: Lexos has recently added the capability to import Mallet 'topic-counts' output files to visualize topics as word clouds, and also to convert topic-counts files into so-called "topic documents" that facilitate cluster analyses of topics. See Lexos > Visualize > Multicloud)
- [Overview](https://www.overviewproject.org/) (open-source web-based tool designed originally for journalists needing to sort large numbers of stories automatically and cluster them by subject/topic; includes visualization and reading interface; allows for import of documents in PDF and other formats. "Overview has been used to analyze emails, declassified document dumps, material from Wikileaks releases, social media posts, online comments, and more." Can also be installed on one's own server)
- [Voyant Tools](http://voyant-tools.org/) (Online text reading and analysis environment with multiple capabilities that presents statistics, concordance views, visualizations, and other analytical perspectives on texts in a dashboard-like interface. Works with plain text, HTML, XML, PDF, RTF, and MS Word files [multiple files best uploaded as a zip file]. Also comes with two pre-loaded sets of texts to work on (Shakespeare's works and the Humanist List archives [click the “Open” button on the main page to see these sets])

  - [VoyantServer](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/run-your-own/voyant-server/) (downloadable Java-based version of Voyant Tools that can be installed and run locally on desktop or laptop computer)
- **Topic Modeling**: (Currently, Mallet is the standard, off-the-shelf tool that scholars in the humanities use for topic modeling. [Specifically, Mallet is is a "LDA" or Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling tool. For good "simple" explanations of LDA topic modeling intended for humanist and other scholars, see [Edwin Chen](http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/) and [Ted Underwood's posts.](http://tedunderwood.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/)] It is a command-line tool that requires students to fuss with exact strings of commands and path names. But the few GUI-interface implementations that now exist such as the [Topic Modeling Tool](http://dhresourcesforprojectbuilding.pbworks.com/w/page/69244319/Digital%20Humanities%20Tools#topic-modeling-tool-java) do not allow for enough customization of options for serious exploration.)
  - [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/index.php) (Download source for Mallet, which must be installed in your local computer's root directory. See the Programming Historian's excellent [tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) for installing and starting with Mallet.)

### Stopwords

(Lists of frequent, functional, and other words with little independent semantic value that text-analyis tools can be instructed to ignore--e.g., by loading a stopword list into Antconc [[instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHYrfxijblY&feature=youtube_gdata), at 8:15 in tutorial video] or Mallet [[instructions](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/import-stoplist.php)]. Researchers conducting certain kinds of text analysis (such as topic modeling) where common words, spelled-out numbers, names of months/days, or proper nouns such as "John" indiscriminately connect unrelated themes often apply stopword lists. Usually they start with a standard stopword list such as the Buckley-Salton or Fox lists and add words tailored to the specific texts they are studying. For instance, typos, boilerplate words or titles, and other features specific to a body of materials can be stopped out. For other purposes in text analysis such as stylistic study of authors, nations, or periods, common words may be included rather than being stopped out because their frequency and participation in patterns offer meaningful clues.)
